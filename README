This is boiler-plate code for an open-world first-person shooter game.

Vision: Provide first-person shooter roleplaying gameplay similar to the recent
installments of The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, albeit with the addition of 
couch-multiplayer coop.

Strategy:
I aim to assemble a minimally-viable feature-complete version of the game.
I then aim to improve the user-experience by revisiting existing features.
After this stage, my aim will be to provide compelling assets to immerse the
player in a rich game world.
