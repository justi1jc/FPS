This is boiler-plate code for an open-world first-person shooter game.
These scripts work with Unity3D editor 2017.1.1xf1 Ubuntu links below.
https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/
http://beta.unity3d.com/download/f4fc8fd4067d/public_download.html

Vision: Provide first-person shooter roleplaying gameplay similar to the recent
installments of The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, albeit with the addition
of couch-multiplayer coop.

Strategy:
An iterative development cycle will occur at each expansion of this project's
scope.

1. Tech Demo phase: Base code for new features will be expanded using
placeholder assets and content.
2. Product phase: Base code will remain largely unchanged, production turning
instead toward assets and content.
3. Product release: A polished product will be sold. Assets and content may or
may not be re-used on next iteration.
