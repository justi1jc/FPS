This is boiler-plate code for an open-world first-person shooter game.
These scripts work with Unity3D editor 5.6.3xf1. Ubuntu link below.
https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/

Vision: Provide first-person shooter roleplaying gameplay similar to the recent
installments of The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, albeit with the addition
of couch-multiplayer coop.

Strategy:
Basic gameplay mechanics will be solidified in the tech demo phase. Once
the tech demo is finished, content will be developed in order to create a simple
game with between 2 to 10 hours of gameplay for sale as a product.


Tentative roadmap:
0.6.X- World features Update
0.7.X- RPG Features update

Current version: 0.5.4

Goals remaining for World Update

-Encapsulate Holodeck and cartographer implementation.
-Create building class
-Create and store cartographer for map expansion or building placement/removal.
-Add Id to doors, exteriors, buildings
-Add relative coordinates to doors in buildings along with local id.
-Cellsaver should add interior cells to their appropriate buildings, taking
inventory of doors in the process
  Integration of seamless Terrain usage.
